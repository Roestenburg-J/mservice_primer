# mservice_primer
The purpose of this Repo is to serve as a one stop shop to learn about microservices. 

It should incldue a basic intro of a few programming languages that are used to write microservices (candidates as of now are Go or Rust).

It should have some reading materials on microservice theory, enough to gain a basic understanding. 

It sould have a step by step guide to create a deployable microserivce architecture following a toy scenario.
